Using Topological Data Analysis to Understand the Behavior of Convolutional Neural Networks

Inspired from https://www.ayasdi.com/blog/artificial-intelligence/using-topological-data-analysis-understand-behavior-convolutional-neural-networks/.

Using Keppler-Mapper with Single Linkage to visualize the weight kernels distribution inside the layers of a Convolutional neural network.

## PCA Representation of the weights in 2D
